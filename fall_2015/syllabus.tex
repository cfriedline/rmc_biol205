\title{BIOL205: Evolution}
\author{Dr.\ Christopher J.\ Friedline \\ cfriedline@vcu.edu}
\date{Fall 2015}

\begin{document}

\maketitle
\linespread{1.3}

\paragraph{Schedule}
Monday and Wednesday, 1:30 -- 3:00pm, Copely 104

\paragraph{Office hours}
By appointment, usually before or after class.

\paragraph{Required text}
The text book we will be using for this course is \textbf{Evolution (\nth{3}
edition)} by Douglas J.\ Futuyma. This book is an excellent and updated
resource,
and as such, is \textit{required} for this course. It is also available in many
different formats.

\paragraph{Pre-requisites}
BIOL 121 or 122 and basic background in algebra, probability, and statistics.

\paragraph{Assignments and grading}
Three midterm exams will be given, as well
as a cumulative final.  In addition, there will be weekly quizzes based on
assigned readings designed to both reinforce topics from the previous week as
well as acquaint you with reading peer-reviewed, scientific literature.  You
will also write a term paper scientifically reviewing a timely report on some
aspect of evolutionary biology.

Approximately every two weeks, I will pick a paper relevant to the current
topics we are
studying. Discussion of these papers will take place in an online forum where
you will be encouraged to interact not only with each other, but also with me.
Engaging in these informal discussions is \textbf{required} and will count as
part of your class participation score. The more discussion that we generate,
the better you will be able to understand the papers (and the better you will
be able to do come exam time).

In addition to readings, you will write a term paper that scientifically
reviews and analyzes an aspect of evolutionary biology that has been presented
in recent news. I must approve your topic, and you can take this one of two
ways: 1) By providing a much deeper review of the topic if it is a
scientifically sound story, or 2) Providing the correct scientific analysis of
the topic if it is incorrectly reported. This paper should be structured like
a scientific review article, provide at least 25 peer-reviewed citations, and
be at least 12 but no more than 25 pages.  This paper will be due by the last
day of class, with other milestones sprinkled throughout the semester.

I will also assign relevant problems at the end of each chapter as well as any
additional exercises I think will aid in your understanding. These will be
distributed via Moodle, and \textbf{will not} be graded.  However, they may be
similar to problems you will encounter on exams.  It is in your best interest
to understand how to solve them, and I encourage you to work together with
classmates and bring questions to me.


\paragraph{Academic integrity}
Students are responsible for reading and
understanding the College's Code of Academic Integrity.  If cheating or
plagiarism is suspected, the situation will be handled as described in
Fishtales, Code of Academic Integrity. You should know that I take this \textbf
{very seriously}.

\paragraph{Students with disabilities}
Please arrange a meeting with me if you
require special accommodations for a physical, psychological, or learning
disability.  Please note that you must first register with the Office for
Disability Support Services, located in the Higgins Academic Center, in order
to be accommodated.
